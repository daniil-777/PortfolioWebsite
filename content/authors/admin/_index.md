Hi! Iâ€™m a final year MSc student studying [Computational Science](https://rw.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I am interested in machine learning engineering, software development and research as well.  I would love to work on any problem dealing with 3D structure and geometry. I am keen on building highly accurate intelligent systems with self-explanatory user-friendly design. Towards this goal, I am interested in the topics of [Robotics](/tags/robotics/), [3D vision](/tags/3D_Vision/), [Image Analysis](/tags/Image_Analysis/) and [Structural Bioinformatics](/tags/Structural_Bioinformatics/). During my masters I worked on [Computer Vision](/tags/Computer_Vision/),[De novo drug design](/tags/de-novo-drug-design) and many projects related to robotics. 


Before starting my masters study, I finished my undergraduate with honours and distinction at [Moscow Institute of Physics and technology](https://mipt.ru/english/) in Moscow. I studied physics, electrical engineering and data science there. In the meanwhile, I did internship in [Amgen](https://www.amgen.com/) in Zurich working on medical image analysis. Also, I focused on many problems in healthcare including neuroscience, proteins analysis and patient disease progression modeling.
